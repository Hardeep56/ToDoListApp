Purpose:
The primary goal of this project was to develop an Android to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application focuses on implementing persistent data storage using an SQLite database, enabling the app to save tasks between sessions.
Development Process & Obstacles:
During development, one of the main challenges was ensuring data consistency across various operations. Implementing the SQLite database required learning about Android’s SQLiteOpenHelper class, managing database connections, and properly handling SQL queries. Debugging SQL syntax errors and ensuring the UI accurately reflected the database state were significant learning points. Additionally, creating a responsive and user-friendly interface was challenging when integrating dynamic data from the database.
Skills Acquired:
•	Understanding and implementing SQLite database operations in Android.
•	Managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQL.
•	Building dynamic user interfaces that update in real-time based on database changes.
•	Enhancing debugging and problem-solving skills by resolving issues related to data persistence and UI responsiveness.
